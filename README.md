# pgr_database
Scripts and CSV files for generating the PGR relational database

The goal of this project is to create a relational database with all the available data from https://philosophicalgourmet.com so as to easily access institution scores and details, track trends over iterations of the PGR, and create visualizations. 

The files I will keep here will be as follows:

1) Scripts for transforming CSV files into relational database tables (Python)
2) Scripts for creating visualizations (Python, R)
3) SQL queries
4) CSV files

I will hopefully share the database when it is finished and I deem it useful for others to use.
